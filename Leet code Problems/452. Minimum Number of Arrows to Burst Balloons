There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane.
The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. 
You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. 
A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. 
There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.


Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
Example 3:

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

In this we are sorting the 2d array with the ending point using the lambda function
and then select the first ballow as a previous 
and then compare with the ending point of previous should be greater than the start of next and the previous of the end is lesser the end of next
if it is means it is over lapping and the one arrow is enough else
then add a arrow and add the current ballon to the previous and then return the arrow at the end.



import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        Arrays.sort(points,(a,b) -> a[1]-b[1]);
        int arrow =1, previous = points[0][1];
        for(int i =1; i<n; i++){
            if(previous >= points[i][0] && previous <= points[i][1]){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                arrow++;
                previous = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        return arrow;
    }
}
