In the below code it will first divide the number with 10 that makes reducing a single digit and then we have to count it

public class Solution {
    public static int countDigits(int n){
        // Write your code here.
       int counter =0;
        while(n>0){
            counter++;
            n = n /10;
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
